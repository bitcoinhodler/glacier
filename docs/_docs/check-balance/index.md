The Viewing Protocol is a simple procedure for viewing your balance of funds currently in one cold storage address.

1. Open your electronic copy of the Cold Storage Information Page (see Section II for details).
2. Go to Blockr , paste your cold storage address into the search bar, and press Enter.
3. You’ll be taken to a page that says “Bitcoin Address” at the top, with your cold storage address listed underneath.
4. Your balance will be listed on the page.
