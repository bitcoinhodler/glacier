  step-by-step protocol for storing bitcoins in a highly secure way

1. Shut down any nearby computers or smartphones, or other devices with cameras.
2. Immediate storage of
<span class="danger">Cold Storage Information Packets</span>
    1. Double-check to make sure each envelope contains a handwritten private
    key and a <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span>.
    2. Seal each envelope.
    3. Use tamper-resistant seals in addition to the envelope's normal adhesive
    to seal it.
    4. **Immediately** put all
    <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Packets</span> in the safest
    possible location in your home or office that is immediately accessible.
    5. No, really. Like right now. That's basically a huge pile of cash you
    have just sitting there in envelopes on your desk.
3. Hardware storage
    1. Put tamper-resistant seals on the ends of all USB drives.
    2. Close the quarantined laptops, and seal the screen shut with a
    tamper-resistant seal.
    3. Store the hardware somewhere where it is unlikely to be used by accident.
4. Maintenance planning
  1. Create a reminder for yourself in six months to execute the
  [Maintenance Protocol](../check-balance/maintenance/){: target="_blank" ._} .
  (If you don't have a reminder system you trust, find one on the web.)
5. Long-term storage of
<span class="danger">Cold Storage Information Packets</span>
    1. As soon as possible, transfer each
    <span class="danger">Cold Storage Information Packet</span> to its secure
    storage location (e.g. safe deposit box).
    2. Don't put more than one <span class="danger">packet</span> in long-term
    storage in the same building!
    Storing two keys in the same building increases the risk of losing both
    keys in a disaster (e.g. fire) or to a thorough thief.
    3. If you are entrusting any <span class="danger">packets</span> to trusted signatories:
        1. Do **not** send them the <span class="danger">packet</span>
        electronically -- no e-mail, no photograph, no "secure instant
        message". If they are distant, using a courier service is probably
        fine, as long as you get tracking and send
        <span class="danger">packets</span> on different days and/or from
        different locations prevents an opportunistic thief from happening
        across two of your private keys. Also avoids a case where you send all
        your keys out in the same batch, and that entire batch is lost -- along
        with your access to your money.
        2. Tell them verbally who the other signatories are, to facilitate
        access to funds if you are dead or incapacitated.
        3. Instruct them not to keep any related notes on or with the
        <span class="danger">packets</span>.
        In the event the key is seen by someone untrustworthy or stolen by a
        random thief, such clues help them understand the significance of the
        key and give them an incentive to plot further thefts or attacks.
        4. Remember that signatories will have the ability to know your cold
        storage balance!

You have finished securing your cold storage funds.
