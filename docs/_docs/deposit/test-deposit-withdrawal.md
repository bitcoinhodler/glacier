title: Test deposit and withdrawal
description:
---

It’s important to make sure everything is working properly before proceeding. You’ll verify this by making a token deposit to, and withdrawal from, your cold storage address.

Depositing funds requires the Internet, and does not require
handling any critically sensitive cold storage data, so you can use any Internet-connected computer for this section.

1. Open your electronic copy of the Cold Storage Information Page (see Section II for details).
2. Perform a test deposit.
  a. Use the wallet software or service of your choice to send the approximate equivalent of $6 USD71 of bitcoins to your cold storage address.
    i. Copy-paste your cold storage address from the C old Storage Information Page into the wallet software.
  b. Wait for the Bitcoin network to confirm the transaction at least once. The way you tell whether a transaction has been confirmed varies depending on the software or service you are using to send funds, but it should be displayed prominently.
3. Perform a test withdrawal.
  a. Execute the Withdrawal Protocol to withdraw the remaining balance ($6 USD - deposit fees) from cold storage to a regular Bitcoin address of your choice.
  b. Wait for the Bitcoin network to confirm the transaction at least once. (Instructions for doing this are in the Withdrawal protocol.)
